# putStrLn "Hello There"

This repo contains my AoC 2021 solutions. 
Might be incomplete.  

Most of them probably in Haskell Î».

If you look for efficient solutions, don't look here, Im still learning.  

[But have a look at this](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2021/blob/master/reflections.md#day-1)!
