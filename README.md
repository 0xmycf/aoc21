# putStrLn "Hello There"

This repo contains my AoC 2021 solutions. 
Might be incomplete.
Most of them probably in Haskell Î».

If you look for efficient solutions, don't look here, Im still learning,
    [but have a look at this](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2021/blob/master/reflections.md#day-1)!  


# Structure and Plans

I didn't had much stack knowledge before starting this project so its kind of a mess right now.
    Eventually I will organize it properly, but one step after the other. 
I will also add a small reflection about each day.
    In there I'll talk about what I learned, how easy it was for me, my way of thinking.  

Benchmarks will follow too after I've build a proper (more or less) bench suit.
