    Some basic geometry:
    A-|â€“A' , where g is a line. The interception of the perpendicular of g through A is called F.
      g                         A' is the mirrored point of A if the following is true:
                                        1. A = F = A' or A - F - A' (they're collinear)
                                        2. d(A,F) = d(F,A'), where d(P,P') is the distance from a Point P to a Point P'

    Finding a distance function:
    The euclidean distance (in R^2) would look like this:
    -- | euclidean distance
    -- dist :: Floating a => V2 a -> V2 a -> a
    -- dist (V2 a b) (V2 x y) = sqrt $ (a - x)^(2 :: Integer) + (b - y)^(2 :: Integer)

    This is not suited for our needs though, since our Points are Integer points
    and the distance will always be of type Integer, since they also lie on one straight line.

    We can simply use this function:
    abs $ (a - x) + (b - y)
    Why? Because either a = x or b = y will be true
    and the distance is just the absolute value of difference of the other components.

-- | mirrors a Point p on the line g
--   this function is constrained to the problem (g lies either on the X or Y axis)
-- mirror :: Fold -> Point -> Point
mirror :: Fold -> Point -> Point
mirror (Fold Y v) p@(V2 x _) = V2 x (v - dist p (V2 x v))
mirror (Fold X v) p@(V2 _ y) = V2 (v - dist p (V2 v y)) y
