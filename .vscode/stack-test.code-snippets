	// Place your AOC21 workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"test func": {
		"prefix": "test",
		"body": [
			"testDay${1:day} :: IO ()",
			"testDay${1:day} = do",
    		"    putStrLn \"Test Day ${1:day}...\"",
			"    $0",
    		"    putStrLn \"Test Day ${1:day} over.\\n \""
		],
		"description": "Basic outline of every test function"
	},
	"main func": {
		"prefix": "main",
		"body": [
			"mainDay${1:day} :: IO ()",
			"mainDay${1:day} = putStrLn \"Day ${1:day}...\" >> problemOne >> problemTwo >> putStrLn \"Day ${1:day} over.\\n\""
